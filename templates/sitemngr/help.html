<h1>Instructions</h1><br>

<h3>How to acess this site</h3>
The requirements for seeing anything on this site are as follow:
<br>
You must
<div style="background-color: #E6E6E6; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; text-align: center; width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><strong>1.</strong> be viewing the site in the Eve in-game browser (IGB),</li>
        <li><strong>2.</strong> have the site on your <a href="http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/IGB_Headers">Trusted Sites list</a>, and</li>
        <li><strong>3.</strong> be playing on a character in the OI alliance</li>
    </ul>
</div>

You will then be able to access data properly.
<br><br>
To test that everything is working correctly, go to <a href="/sitemngr/igbtest">the igb test page</a>. If you see nothing besides the nav<br>
menu and the header, you're missing a step. If you see a readout of your character's information, you're golden.
<br>
Also, look at the right side of the upper nav bar. If you see "Welcome, [your character's name]," you're golden. If it says "Please be<br>
in-game and have the site Trusted," then you're doing something wrong.

<hr><h3>What are you using the igb data for?</h3>
I check your character's name, alliance, and location for storage, verification, and storage, respectively.<br>
All that other data I could get I don't care about.

<hr><h3>Viewing current data overview</h3>
To see an overview of data currently in the system, visit the <a href="/sitemngr/">index page</a>.
<br><br>
To see if any of the systems in the chain are hot, see the <a href="/sitemngr/checkkills">check kills page</a>. Note that it can take a long time to load.
<br><br>
To see a system's status, view it's page at <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">/sitemngr/system/[SYSTEM_NAME]</span>.<br>
You can view a universe overview at <a href="/sitemngr/system">/sitemngr/system/</a> to see which system have open sites.
<br><br>
To get information for just Nexus, click on the <a href="/sitemngr/output">Output current data</a> link on the left.

<hr><h3>Update the database by pasting</h3>
The <a href="/sitemngr/paste/">paste page</a> is for quick and easy data entry into the system by means of copy-pasting<br>
your system scanner's full data into a box and clicking a button.
<br><br>
The site then sees your paste, and breaks each site down and sorts into three (3) categories:
<br><br>
<strong>1. Exist</strong> - These ids are in the database for that system and in your paste. All's good.<br>
<strong>2. Not found</strong> - These ids are in the database for that system, but not<br>in your paste. They may have despawned, so please update accordingly.<br>
<strong>3. New</strong> - These ids are not in the database but are in your scan, so they're probably new.<br>The site will pick out the most information it can find, 
and auto-fill the most fields for you.<br>

<hr><h3>Edit a site individually</h3>
To edit a site, you can either click on its scanid in any system readout or the <a href="/sitemngr/">index page</a>, or go to 
<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">/sitemngr/editsite/[SCAN_ID]</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">/sitemngr/editwormhole/[SCAN_ID]</span> 
(found on the nav menu to the left).

<hr><h3>Adding a site/wormhole manually</h3>
Click the link on the left nav menu. Enter information appropriately, and click the submit button. The site<br>
should read your character's name and location, and auto-fill those fields.

<hr><h3>Graphing</h3>
A fresh graphic layout of the connections from Nexus are generated every 5 minutes. You can see the map on the <a href="/sitemngr/">homepage</a>.<br><br>
The circle colors are as such:<br>
HS = gold<br>
LS = purple<br>
NS = brown<br>
C1 = blue<br>
C2 = green<br>
C3 = yellow<br>
C4 = orange<br>
C5 = red<br>
C6 = black<br>
not found = black<br><br>
It is important, then, to really be sure that you're typing system names as they are in-game.

<hr><h3>Submiting bugs and feature requests</h3>
Visit the <a href="http://tracker.talkinlocal.org/knowledge/">support center</a>. This app is in Beta, so everything <i>should</i> work, but in case it doesn't, don't primary me.

<hr><h2 style="color: red;">TL;DR</h2>
Use the <a href="/sitemngr/paste">paste page</a> to have the site tell you what needs to be done. Do those things.

<hr>
