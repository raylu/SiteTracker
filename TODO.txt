! After downtime paste page does not save data - seems to be saving its original scanid
Add "Mark as Up to Date" button on index page and tie it auto into paste.
	2 fields on index page: last edited and last up to date
Change index page's wormhole countdown to a count up
Index page canceling an in-line edit displays the scanid column wrong. Still correct in database.
Index page's last updated feature is not working with WormholeSnapshots - incorrectly calculating last updated
Research and set up tests because I keep breaking things with updates
Different times for different wormhole connection types - where to pull this data from?
