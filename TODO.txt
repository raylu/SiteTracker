! After downtime paste page does not save data - is saving its original scanid
Auto-mark the database as up to date when a paste into the home system returns all in the first column
Index page canceling an in-line edit displays the scanid column wrong. Still correct in database.
Index page's last updated feature is not working with WormholeSnapshots - incorrectly calculating last updated
Research and set up tests because I keep breaking things with updates
